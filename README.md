# Time Diary

A cool application for keeping track of how time is spent.

## User Stories

A user can:

* Hit a button to record the current time as a transition time.
* Enter the title of what was done during the previous timeslot, as well as pick from one of several categories for that timeslot.
* Have that data saved (as MVP, this will be in localstorage)
* View how past time was spent (as MVP, as a list; in the future, as a chart)
* Edit past timeslots' duration and content.

## Technology

Time Diary is a basic webapp created using Bootstrap and jQuery.
